# Cats-and-a-Mouse-algo
This code solves the Cats and a Mouse problem by determining which cat will reach a mouse first or if the mouse will escape. The code calculates the absolute distance each cat is from the mouse and compares them to determine the winner, declaring the mouse safe if both cats are equally distant.
